Hi! I get a lot of technology questions, and oft times I find
myself repeating the same advice. I made this page to streamline
the process, and make it easier for you to solve your problem.

**Don't**:
* Call me
* Text me
* Email me

**Do follow the instructions in this document**

## FAQ

Here is a list of frequently asked questions. This list will be expanded as more questions pour in.

### My account was hacked, can you help me?

I'm sorry to hear that, but there is more *you* can do than I can!
Here are some immediate steps you should take:

1. Change the passwords on all your other accounts, and enable 2FA.
2. Go through the security settings for your remaining accounts and ensure your recovery options are up to date
3. Begin the recovery process for your accounts.

Here are some helpful links:

* Facebook

  - Settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings
* Google
  - Account: http://www.google.com/accounts
  - Recovery: https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery

### Will you hack something for me?

No. Fuck off.

And before you make an excuse: I hate repeating myself, but fuck right off.

### Can you make my website for me?

Yes, but you're going out of favor terrority and approaching work territory. I
design web applications on a contractual basis, and I'm very good at them. If
you want to hire me, here's [my freelance profile](https://www.toptal.com/resume/amin-shah-gilani#contract-just-respected-software-architects).

If you're looking to design a plain website for your business really fast I'm probably
a little over your budget, in which case I recommend posting on this [Pakistani freelancer's facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freelancers.pakistan/).

### There's a virus on my computer, can you fix it?

Yes, I can, and you can too:

1. Install an antivirus software
2. Scan your computer
3. Delete all the viruses

That didn't work? It's probably something you recently installed

1. Go to your list of installed software
2. Uninstall any recent programs

It's still there? And you're sure it's a virus? You'll have to reinstall your OS (probably Windows)

1. Buy a copy of the latest windows (Windows 10)
2. Follow [these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/197559/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-pc/).

You can't, and you still want me to do it? Fine, but you'll have to feed me.

1. Backup all your data on an external hard disk
2. Schedule a time with me, this will probably be a week or two later
3. Show up at my house with your laptop and a Windows CD
4. While it's installing, order my favorite food.
5. You're done.

### What laptop or phone should I buy?

It depends on your needs and your budgets. Here's how I search for my new stuff.

For laptops, use the instructions at [this wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-a-Laptop)

Phones:

1. Find canditates via the [helper on the android website](https://www.android.com/phones/whichphone)
2. Compare them using [GSM Arena](http://www.gsmarena.com/)
3. Find the best deal by searching manually, through [Google Shopping](https://www.google.com/shopping?hl=en), or with [NextTag](https://www.nextag.com/)

I personally have a Nexus 6P and a mid-2014 15" Macbook Pro and I don't plan on upgrading in the near future.

### Should I invest in Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital token that has a limited supply. Since there's only a limited supply of bitcoin, you need to pay money to get some, like you would any other commodity e.g. gold. The difference is that bitcoin is entirely digital.

Thus, bitcoin operates a lot like any other commodity like gold or stocks. The price of commodities is determied by market forces.


### I wanna mine bitcoin, how do I do it?

**Please don't ask me for specific advice on your rig.**

Sure, but before you mine bitcoin (BTC), do this:

1. Learn how bitcoin and mining works by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8) for a demonstration.
2. Find your [mining rig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_rig)
3. Run a [Cost-Benefit Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) to determine the feasibility of your mining operation.


#### Costs

Cost components will be priced in fiat money:

* Fixed cost: buying the rig and setting it up
* Variable cost: running electricity cost and depreciation


#### Benefits

Your benefits will be the bitcoin you mine. The real amount may vary but here's how to estimate your mining:

Find the values for these variables:

* `hash_local`: the [hashrate](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison) your rig will give.
* `hash_global`: the total [global hashrate](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate).
* `block_reward`: the current [block reward](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-reward/)  (12.5 BTC per block as I write this)

Your reward for every block in BTC will be:  
 `block_reward * hash_local / (hash_local + hash_global)`

To check if mining is feasible, you'll have to convert your bitcoin into USD, here's a cool [bitcoin price index](http://www.coindesk.com/price/)

#### Notes

These figures may change drastically over time, so [here](https://blockchain.info/charts) are some helpful charts to determine historical trends.


### My question isn't listed here

This list is a perpetual work in progress. Your questions will help this grow. If you still need
help, create an issue [here](https://github.com/amingilani/tech-support/issues/new) and we'll have a conversation :)

You'll have to create a Github account, but that's a small price to pay.

# Tech Support

Hi I get a lot of technology questions, and oft times I find
myself repeating the same advice. I made this page to streamline
the process, and make it easier for you to solve your problem.

Please *don't*:
* Call me
* Text me
* Email me

Please *do read this document* and follow the instructions listed.

## My account was hacked, help me!

I'm sorry to hear that, but there is more *you* can do than I can!
Here are some immediate steps you should take:

1. Change the passwords on all your other accounts, and enable 2FA.
2. Go through the security settings for your remaining accounts and ensure your recovery options are up to date
3. Begin the recovery process for your accounts.

Here are some helpful links:

* Facebook
  - Hacked: http://facebook.com/hacked
  - Settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings
* Google
  - Account: http://www.google.com/accounts
  - Recovery: https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery

## Will you hack an account for me?

No. Fuck off.

## Can you make my website for me?

Yes, but you're going out of favor terrority and approaching work territory. I
design web applications on a contractual basis, and I'm very good at them. If
you want to hire me, here's [my freelance profile](https://www.toptal.com/resume/amin-shah-gilani#contract-just-respected-software-architects).

If you're looking to design a plain website for your business really fast I'm probably
a little over your budget, in which case I recommend posting on this [Pakistani freelancer's facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freelancers.pakistan/).

## There's a virus on my computer, can you fix it?

Yes, I can, and you can too:

1. Install an antivirus software
2. Scan your computer
3. Delete all the viruses

That didn't work? It's probably something you recently installed

1. Go to your list of installed software
2. Uninstall any recent programs

It's still there? And you're sure it's a virus? You'll have to reinstall your OS (probably Windows)

1. Buy a copy of the latest windows (Windows 10)
2. Follow [these instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/197559/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-pc/).

You can't, and you still want me to do it? Fine, but you'll have to feed me.

1. Backup all your data on an external hard disk
2. Schedule a time with me, this will probably be a week or two later
3. Show up at my house with your laptop and a Windows CD
4. While it's installing, order my favorite food.
5. You're done.

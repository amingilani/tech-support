# Tech Support

Hi, you probably have technology questions for me. I get a lot of
being the go to technical friend for everyone. Oft times I find
myself repeating a lot of thing, so I made this page to streamline
the process, and make it easier for you to get your help.

Here's a list of FAQs

## My account was hacked, help me!

I'm sorry to hear that, but there is more *you* can do than I can!
Here are some immediate steps you should take:

1. Change the passwords on all your other accounts, and enable 2FA.
2. Go through the security settings for your remaining accounts and ensure your recovery options are up to date
3. Begin the recovery process for your accounts.

## Will you hack an account for me?

No. Fuck off.

## Can you make my website for me?

Yes, but you're going out of favor terrority and approaching work territory. I
design web applications on a contractual basis, and I'm very good at them. If
you want to hire me, here's [my freelance profile](https://www.toptal.com/resume/amin-shah-gilani#contract-just-respected-software-architects).

If you're looking to design a plain website for your business really fast I'm probably
a little over your budget, in which case I recommend posting on this [Pakistani freelancer's facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freelancers.pakistan/).

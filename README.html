<p>I’m sorry to hear that, but there is more <em>you</em> can do than I can! <br>
Here are some immediate steps you should take:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the passwords on all your other accounts, and enable 2FA.</li>
<li>Go through the security settings for your remaining accounts and ensure your recovery options are up to date</li>
<li>Begin the recovery process for your accounts.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="will-you-hack-an-account-for-me">Will you hack an account for me?</h2>

<p>No. Fuck off.</p>



<h2 id="can-you-make-my-website-for-me">Can you make my website for me?</h2>

<p>Yes, but you’re going out of favor terrority and approaching work territory. I <br>
design web applications on a contractual basis, and I’m very good at them. If <br>
you want to hire me, here’s <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/amin-shah-gilani#contract-just-respected-software-architects">my freelance profile</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to design a plain website for your business really fast I’m probably <br>
a little over your budget, in which case I recommend posting on this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freelancers.pakistan/">Pakistani freelancer’s facebook group</a>.</p>



<h2 id="theres-a-virus-on-my-computer-can-you-fix-it">There’s a virus on my computer, can you fix it?</h2>

<p>Yes, I can, and you can too:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install an antivirus software</li>
<li>Scan your computer</li>
<li>Delete all the viruses</li>
</ol>

<p>That didn’t work? It’s probably something you recently installed</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to your list of installed software</li>
<li>Uninstall any recent programs</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s still there? And you’re sure it’s a virus? You’ll have to reinstall your OS (probably Windows)</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy a copy of the latest windows (Windows 10)</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197559/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-pc/">these instructions</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can’t, and you still want me to do it? Fine, but you’ll have to feed me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Backup all your data on an external hard disk</li>
<li>Schedule a time with me, this will probably be a week or two later</li>
<li>Show up at my house with your laptop and a Windows CD</li>
<li>While it’s installing, order my favorite food.</li>
<li>You’re done.</li>
</ol>
